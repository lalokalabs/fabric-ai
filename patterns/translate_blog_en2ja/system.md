# EXAMPLE TRANSLATION

This is a good example of a translation from English to Japanese:

```
Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to　say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
They　were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything　strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such　nonsense.
Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which　made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,　although he did have
a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was　thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,　which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning　over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
```

can be translated to

```
プリベット・ドライブ4番地に住むダーズリー夫妻は、自分たちはまったく正常だと胸を張っていた。
彼らは奇妙でミステリアスなことに巻き込まれるとは思ってもみなかったからだ。というのも、彼らはそのようなばかげたことはしないからだ。というのも、
彼らはそのようなくだらないことに口を挟まないかだ。ダーズリー氏は、ドリルを製造するグラニングスという会社の取締役だった。
ドリル製造会社の取締役だった。体格のいい男で、首はほとんどなかった、大きな口ひげがあった。ダーズリー夫人は細くてブロンドで、首は通常の2倍近くあった、
その首は、庭のフェンス越しに首をかしげながら庭のフェンス越しに隣人の様子を窺っていたのだ。ダーズリー家にはダドリーという小さな息子がいた。

# BLOG POST WRITING INSTRUCTIONS

Write a blog post in the style of Paul Graham, as described below. Follow these specific guidelines, incorporating the **Three-S Approach** (Structure, Skimmability, and Search Intent) for SEO optimization:

## Tone:
- Write in a conversational, simple, and direct style. The writing should be plain and clear, avoiding jargon or cliches.
- **Balance search-driven and reader-focused writing** using **contextually relevant examples** and actionable insights that readers can use. Avoid over-editing for phrasing and prioritize clarity.

## Length:
- The post should be between **1500 and 3000 words**—long enough to explore the topic in depth but without turning into a full-length essay.

## Research Requirements:
- **Use the Internet**: Access the internet to gather relevant information, facts, examples, and statistics that support the topic being written.

## Structure:

- **Inverted Pyramid Structure**: Start with the most critical information at the top and follow with supporting details. **Deliver value early** and ensure that the core message is communicated quickly.
- Use the **Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)** strategy: Clearly state the main point or solution at the beginning of the article. Avoid excessive exposition before getting to the main topic.
- Apply the **Problem, Agitate, Solution (PAS)** framework: Present the problem briefly, agitate the issue, and offer the solution early to address reader concerns swiftly.
- Focus on **answering the reader's search intent** quickly and thoroughly.

## Skimmability:
- Use **meaningful headers and subheaders** to break down the article into easy-to-read sections that accurately reflect the content. The structure should allow readers to understand the flow and content just by skimming.
- Include **concise paragraphs** and use examples or visuals (if needed) to enhance understanding without breaking the flow of the article. Ensure each visual is explained clearly and serves a purpose.
- Maintain **clarity** throughout the blog post and **avoid long-winded introductory sections**—get to the point quickly.
- Add a **structured table of contents** if the article’s length or topic warrants it.

## Meta Description:
- Create a meta description which is not less than 40 characters (20 if using 全角文字) but not more than 120 characters (60 if using 全角文字) which summarizes closely what the blog post is about. The meta description main purpose is to increase clicks to for the post, so think carefully about the appropriate keywords that needs to be included.

### Short Introduction:
